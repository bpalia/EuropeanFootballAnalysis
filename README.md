# European Football Analysis

The notebook `football_data_analysis.ipynb` provides the analysis of [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) containing information on more than 25 000 matches. The dataset also contains players and teams' attributes from *EA Sports FIFA* video game, betting odds from multiple providers and team line-ups before each match.

The **aim** of this work is to analyze European football dataset and provide insights possibly useful for the sports betting company.

The work **objectives** are as follows:
* Explore the dataset to identify scoring tendencies among leagues, teams and players;
* Formulate and test hypothesis to investigate home advantage phenomena;
* Investigate formation influence on match result;
* Build a model to predict match outcome;
* Build a model to predict goals scored in each match. 

This analysis is accompanied by two appendices. The appendix `appendix_dataset_schema.ipynb` presents dataset content. The appendix `appendix_feature_engineering.ipynb` presents feature creation and initial selection.
